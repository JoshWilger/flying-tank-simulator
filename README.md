## Project Info

A side-scrolling, dodging and shooting game made with a four-person group back in 2020 for our final project. Lasting all semester long, we decided on making a quirky arcade game similar to the [Helicopter game](https://www.crazygames.com/game/helicopter). Using a simple Flappy Bird JavaFX app tutorial to create a basic template, we put together a fun game full of custom game mechanics, sprites, animations, and later adding music and sound effects to top it all off.
